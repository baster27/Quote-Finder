# Quote-Finder
Running projectScript.py will create the data.txt file, which is populated by 100,000 randomly 
generated emails coupled with a random quote from a list of 4 different quotes. Added to the bottom of 
the file are two example emails created by me, coupled with their own unique quotes. Running the 
AlgoHashTable.py file will assign each key value pair (key = email, value = quote) from data.txt to a 
hash table, then search the hash table for the two email addresses at the end of data.txt (the ones 
created by me) and print the unique quotes associated with those email addresses to the console.
